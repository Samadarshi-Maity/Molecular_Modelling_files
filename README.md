For simple yet innovative techniques for Molecular Modelling/ MD and MC

Things to do: 
1. Test the new format for the code and make it look less of an exercise and more of a story.
2. Try to decouple the Verlet from the thermostat
3. Decouple the VACF computation into a separate function
4. finish writing the text in md and not html cm you will need code blocks
